push(element): This method adds a new element to the end of the list.
insert(element, position): This method inserts a new element at a specified
position in the list.
getElementAt(index): This method returns the element of a specific position in
the list. If the element does not exist in the list, it returns undefined.
remove(element): This method removes an element from the list.
indexOf(element): This method returns the index of the element in the list. If
the element does not exist in the list, it returns -1.
removeAt(position): This method removes an item from a specified position in
the list.
isEmpty(): This method returns true if the linked list does not contain any
elements, and false if the size of the linked list is bigger than 0.
size(): This method returns the number of elements the linked list contains.
It is similar to the length property of the array.
toString(): This method returns a string representation of the linked list. As
the list uses a Node class as an element, we need to overwrite the default
toString method inherited from the JavaScript Object class to output only the
element values.
